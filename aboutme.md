Hi all, my name is Tomas Fox, I've been lucky to live in different countries and learn different languages. Fluent in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian, I am now in the process of learning programming languages -- mostly Python -- to be able to handle and make sense of data. I hold a degree in Economics from Bocconi University and worked as a Global Wealth Management Analyst at JP Morgan. After discovering Bitcoin I realized I wanted to work within the Crypto industry and in the past year co-founded a company focused on teaching university students about Bitcoin's and cryptocurrency's fundamentals. 

I recently finished Lambda's Data Science program, and also worked 4 months as a Team Lead, where I helped other students with the ultimate goal of making their path to find an industry job a little bit easier. 

I have worked with other Data Scientists and Software Engineers in projects ranging from data visualization and predictive modeling to NLP and neural networks. Currently looking for a job in the cryptocurrency industry!
