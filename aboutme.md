Hi all, my name is Tomas Fox, I've been lucky to live in different countries and learn different languages. Fluent in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian, I am now in the process of learning programming languages -- mostly Python -- to be able handle and make sense of data. I hold a degree in Economics from Bocconi University and have experience in the banking sector, having worked as a Global Wealth Management Analyst at JP Morgan. After discovering Bitcoin I realized I wanted to work within the Crypto industry and in the past year co-founded a company focused on teaching university students about Bitcoin's and cryptocurrency's fundamentals. 

Currently enrolled in Lambda School's Data Science program with the ultimate goal of working in a Crypto startup committed to developing the decentralized finance space.
