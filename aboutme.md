Hi all, my name is Tomas Fox, I've been lucky to live in different countries and learn different languages. Fluent in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian, I am now in the process of learning programming languages -- mostly Python -- to be able to handle and make sense of data. I hold a degree in Economics from Bocconi University and worked as a Global Wealth Management Analyst at JP Morgan. After discovering Bitcoin I realized I wanted to work within the Crypto industry and in the past year co-founded a company focused on teaching university students about Bitcoin's and cryptocurrency's fundamentals. 

After finishing Lambda's Data Science bootcamp, I was givn the opportunity to work fot 4 months as a Team Lead at Lambda, where I was in charge of 8 students, reviewing their code daily and teaching them topics in descriptive statistics, predictive stastistics, software engineering and machine learning. 

I have worked with other Data Scientists and Software Engineers in projects ranging from data visualization and predictive modeling to NLP and neural networks. Currently looking for a job in the cryptocurrency industry!
