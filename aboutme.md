Hi all, my name is Tomas Fox, I’ve been lucky to live in different countries and learn different languages. Fluent in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian, I am now in the process o	f learning programming languages – mostly Python and SQL – to be able to handle and make sense of data. I hold a degree in Economics from Bocconi University and worked as a Global Wealth Management Analyst at JP Morgan.

After discovering Bitcoin I decided to leave JP Morgan; I realized I wanted to work within the crypto and the education industry, which led me to co-found a company focused on teaching university students about Bitcoin’s and cryptocurrencies’ fundamentals. After 1.5 years as an entrepreneur, I decided to shift onto the technical side of things and enrolled in Lambda School’s Data Science program. 

After finishing Lambda’s Data Science bootcamp, I was given the opportunity to work alongside students as a Team Lead, where I was in charge of 8 students, reviewing their code daily and teaching them topics in descriptive statistics, predictive statistics, software engineering and machine learning.

I have worked with other Data Scientists and Software Engineers in projects ranging from data visualization and predictive modeling to Natural Language Processing and Neural Networks. I am ideally looking for a Data Science or Data Analyst job in the cryptocurrency industry, however, I am open to other roles too in which I can develop my DS skills.
