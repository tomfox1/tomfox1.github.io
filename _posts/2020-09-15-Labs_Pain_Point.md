[A Natural Language Processing project using Open AI's GPT-2](https://ninenineproblems.com/)

Check out my project on [Github](https://github.com/labs15-pain-point)!

**Highlights:** 
* Applied a script for web scraping using Selenium and BeautifulSoup to collect data from AngelList
* Fed ~ 170,00 company descriptions from Crunchbase into Open-AI’s NLP GPT-2 model and generated usable human-readable project ideas  
* Fine-tuned GPT-2’s language model hyper-parameters to increase model’s semantic output
* Utilized word and entity frequency metrics to further filter through array of company descriptions
* Deployed a web app using Netlify and hosted database on Firebase & learned the basics of Javascript
